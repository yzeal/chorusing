# Summary of Improvements to the Japanese Pitch Accent Training Web App

## Today's Improvements

1. **Fixed "Jump to Playback" Functionality**
   - Corrected the issue where the chart view wasn't updating properly when jumping to the current playback position
   - Exposed internal state management functions from the PitchGraph component
   - Added timeouts to ensure data loading completes before updating the view
   - Improved coordination between data loading and view changes

2. **Added Error Handling for Pitch Detection**
   - Fixed errors occurring when processing incomplete frames at the end of audio files
   - Added robust error handling throughout the pitch detection process
   - Implemented proper TypeScript error handling for unknown error types

3. **Improved End-of-File Pitch Detection**
   - Enhanced the pitch detection to handle the end of audio files by implementing zero-padding
   - Ensured the entire pitch curve is displayed including the final segments
   - Fixed frame size issues when nearing the end of audio files or segments
   - Implemented special handling for file boundaries to avoid data loss

4. **Adjusted Pitch Detection Parameters**
   - Made it possible to detect more speech segments by adjusting MIN_CLARITY threshold

## Future Concern: Navigating Long Videos

When working with long videos, the current user flow for finding and practicing specific sections is somewhat cumbersome:

**Current workflow:**
1. User plays the video to find relevant content
2. User clicks "Jump to playback" to see that section in the pitch curve
3. User must click "Loop visible" to set the loop region
4. User then must click play again in the video player

**Potential solutions to consider:**
1. **Auto-loop current view**: When jumping to playback position, automatically set the loop region to the current view
2. **Preview without changing loop**: Add a "preview mode" that shows the pitch at the current playback time without changing the loop region
3. **Seek bar integration**: Integrate a minimap or timeline below the video player showing pitch intensity, allowing direct navigation
4. **Segment bookmarking**: Allow users to bookmark important segments for quick navigation
5. **Side-by-side navigation**: Split screen view showing video thumbnails alongside pitch curves for easier navigation

These improvements would maintain current functionality while making it easier for users to navigate and practice specific sections in longer videos. 

**Chosen solution:**
**Auto-loop current view**: When jumping to playback position, automatically set the loop region to the current view
This sounds good. Maybe have it as a checkbox (default: false) and otherwise perform a "loop visible" after "jump to playback" automatically as well as after panning or zooming.
