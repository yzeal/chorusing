# Options Menu Notes

## Options Menu

- Option to choose smoothing/filtering method for pitch curves
- Keyboard shortcuts customization
  - Play/Pause native recording: spacebar
  - Loop visivle: l
  - Start/stop user microphone recording: r
  - Play/Pause user recording: e
- **Microphone selection dropdown for desktop browsers only** (use `enumerateDevices` and `getUserMedia` with `deviceId`; hide on mobile for cleaner UI and because it's not supported)
- **Tooltip configuration options:**
  - Enable/disable tooltips globally
- **Pitch detection range settings:**
  - Allow users to adjust minimum and maximum pitch detection thresholds
  - Default: 60-500 Hz (suitable for speech)
  - Extended range option: up to 1000-1500 Hz (for singing or high-pitched voices)
  - Warning that very wide ranges may affect detection accuracy for normal speech
- **Loop overlay appearance:**
  - Adjust transparency/color of loop overlay

## UI/UX Design Guidelines
- **Individual reset buttons:**
  - Every user-configurable setting should have its own small reset button
  - Reset buttons should have tooltip text "Restore default value"
  - Use the same design as "Reset loop region" button (small circular arrow)
  - Position reset buttons consistently next to each option for intuitive use
  - Reset buttons should only be visible/active when the value differs from default
