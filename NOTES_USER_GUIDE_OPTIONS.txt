# User Guide & Options Menu Notes

## User Guide
- Supported file formats for different browsers and platforms
- Warning about sudden volume change when recording on iOS, especially with headphones
- On iOS, pitch extraction from .mov and some video files may not work; recommend using .mp3, .wav, or .m4a audio files or converting videos before use
- All browsers on iOS (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.) have the same audio and media limitations due to WebKit; there is no workaround in web apps
- If audio output volume is stuck after recording on iOS, try reloading the page or closing the tab to restore normal volume control
- **Initial audio quality in browser:**
  Sometimes, when playing audio or video for the first time in the browser, the quality may be lower or have artifacts for the first second or two. This is due to browser/decoder warmup and usually self-corrects quickly. Possible improvements include waiting for the `canplaythrough` event before playback, but this is a common browser limitation. Consider mentioning this in the user guide as a known issue.
- **Recording length recommendations:**
  For optimal performance and user experience, recommend recordings between 5-30 seconds. The app can handle recordings up to 2 minutes, but very long recordings may affect performance on older devices. Very short recordings (<1 second) may not provide enough data for accurate pitch detection.

## Options Menu (future ideas)
- Customizable loop delay for native and user recordings
- Adjustable y-axis range and auto-fit options for pitch graphs
- Toggle for showing/hiding playback indicator on pitch graphs
- Option to select audio input/output devices (where supported)
- Option to choose smoothing/filtering method for pitch curves
- Keyboard shortcuts customization
- **Microphone selection dropdown for desktop browsers only** (use `enumerateDevices` and `getUserMedia` with `deviceId`; hide on mobile for cleaner UI and because it's not supported)
- **Tooltip configuration options:**
  - Enable/disable tooltips globally
  - Separate toggle for mobile/desktop devices
  - Customizable tooltip content and appearance
  - Option to show tooltips only when graph is paused
- **Pitch detection range settings:**
  - Allow users to adjust minimum and maximum pitch detection thresholds
  - Default: 60-500 Hz (suitable for speech)
  - Extended range option: up to 1000-1500 Hz (for singing or high-pitched voices)
  - Warning that very wide ranges may affect detection accuracy for normal speech
- **Loop overlay appearance:**
  - Adjust transparency/color of loop overlay
  - Option to completely hide loop overlay for user recordings where looping is not needed

## UI/UX Design Guidelines
- **Individual reset buttons:**
  - Every user-configurable setting should have its own small reset button
  - Reset buttons should have tooltip text "Restore default value"
  - Use the same design as "Reset loop region" button (small circular arrow)
  - Position reset buttons consistently next to each option for intuitive use
  - Reset buttons should only be visible/active when the value differs from default

Adding navigation pages
Adding a user guide and settings page with icon buttons is a solid approach:
Use standard icons like ? for help/guide and ⚙️ for settings
You could implement these in a header/navbar component
React Router would be perfect for handling navigation between pages
