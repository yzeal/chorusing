## Recording Length Recommendations

For the best experience with the Pitch Accent Training app, consider these guidelines for your recordings:

### Optimal Recording Length
- **Ideal Length**: 5-30 seconds
- **Maximum Recommended**: 2 minutes

### Why Short Recordings Work Better
1. **Better Focus**: Short recordings help you focus on specific pitch patterns or problem areas
2. **Easier Comparison**: Comparing your recording with the native sample is more effective with shorter segments
3. **Clearer Visualization**: The pitch graph is more readable and detailed with shorter recordings
4. **Faster Feedback**: You can iterate and improve more quickly with shorter practice segments
5. **Performance**: Browser performance remains smooth with shorter recordings

### Tips for Effective Practice
- Record individual words or short phrases when starting out
- Progress to full sentences as you improve
- For longer content, break it into 15-30 second segments
- Use the loop region feature to practice specific parts of longer recordings
- Practice the same segment multiple times rather than recording longer passages

### Technical Considerations
While there is no hard limit on recording length, browser performance may degrade with very long recordings, especially on mobile devices. The app has been optimized for recordings in the 5-30 second range, which is ideal for focused practice.

   - Record your own voice using the microphone button
   - Visually compare your pitch pattern with the native speaker
   
2. **Focus on specific segments**:
   - Zoom in on challenging parts of the utterance
   - Set a tight loop region around difficult pitch patterns
   - Adjust the loop delay if needed to give yourself time to repeat
   
3. **Mobile-specific tips**:
   - Hold your device in landscape orientation for better visualization
   - Use small, deliberate pinch gestures for precise zooming
   - Tap the reset zoom button (↺) if you get lost

## Pitch Visualization Details

The pitch visualization shows the fundamental frequency (pitch) of the voice over time:

- **Blue line**: Your recorded voice
- **Green line**: Native speaker's voice
- **Solid lines**: Voiced speech segments (vowels, voiced consonants)
- **Dashed lines**: Transitions or less reliable pitch segments
- **Vertical red line**: Current playback position

The y-axis shows frequency in Hertz (Hz), typically ranging from 50-500 Hz, with male voices generally lower (80-180 Hz) and female voices higher (160-300 Hz).
