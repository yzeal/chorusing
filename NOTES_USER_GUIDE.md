## Purpose of the Chorusing Trainer

The purpose of this tool is to provide an easy way to do high repetition chorusing practice.
Chorusing in language learning is the practice of learners repeating words or phrases in unison with a native speaker or instructor.
It's especially effective for developing fluency and natural speech in early stages of language acquisition, but will be helpful at any stage.

### Benefits
- Reinforces correct pronunciation, rhythm, and intonation
- Builds muscle memory for speech patterns
- Reduces anxiety about speaking (supposedly)
- Aids listening and imitation skills through synchronized repetition

### The Method
- Play a word, phrase or short sentence spoken by a native speaker in a loop
- Just listen a few times, really focus on what you hear (sounds, rhythm, pitch)
- Then say it out loud at exactly the same time as the native speaker
- Repeat this 10, 50, 100 times until you can match their rhythm perfectly
- Record yourself and see if your pitch curve shape matches that of the native speaker
- Repeat, repeat, repeat until you get it as perfect as you feel you can for that day
- Only then move on to another word, phrase or short sentence
- Do this daily for a few weeks and see


## Recording Length Recommendations

For the best experience with the Chorusing Training app, consider these guidelines for your recordings:

### Optimal Recording Length
- **Ideal Length**: 5-30 seconds
- **Maximum Recommended**: 2 minutes

### Why Short Recordings Work Better
1. **Better Focus**: Short recordings help you focus on specific pitch patterns or problem areas
2. **Easier Comparison**: Comparing your recording with the native sample is more effective with shorter segments
3. **Clearer Visualization**: The pitch graph is more readable and detailed with shorter recordings
4. **Faster Feedback**: You can iterate and improve more quickly with shorter practice segments
5. **Performance**: Browser performance remains smooth with shorter recordings

### Tips for Effective Practice
- Record individual words or short phrases when starting out
- Progress to full sentences as you improve
- For longer content, break it into 15-30 second segments
- Use the loop region feature to practice specific parts of longer recordings
- Practice the same segment multiple times rather than recording longer passages

### Technical Considerations
While there is no hard limit on recording length, browser performance may degrade with very long recordings, especially on mobile devices. The app has been optimized for recordings in the 5-30 second range, which is ideal for focused practice. Loading large video files on mobile devices can likewise be problematic. Consider editing large files or making short screen recordings of segments you want to practice.

### Caution!
On the iPhone, starting a recording inside a web browser will cause all audio output to use the ringer's audio level. This can by default be very loud!

To gain control over the ringer level on iPohne, you can:
- **Open Settings**: Find and tap the Settings app on your iPhone's home screen
- **Go to Sounds & Haptics**: Scroll down and tap on "Sounds & Haptics"
- **Adjust Ringer Volume**: In the "Ringer and Alerts" section, you'll see a slider. Drag the slider left or right to adjust the ringer volume to your desired level
- **Change with Buttons (Optional)**: If you prefer to use the volume buttons, you can enable "Change with Buttons" by toggling the switch to the right

- **Jump to playback**: Jumps the view to center around the current playback position (only available for long videos)

## Tips for Effective Practice

1. **Compare native and your recordings**:
   - Load a native recording using the "Load Native Recording" button
   - Record your own voice using the microphone button
   - Visually compare your pitch pattern with the native speaker
   - The overall shape of the curve is important. Its position on the y-axis can differ depending on the natural pitch of your voice
   
2. **Focus on specific segments**:
   - Zoom in on challenging parts of the utterance
   - Set a tight loop region around difficult pitch patterns
   - Adjust the loop delay if needed to give yourself time to breathe between repetitions
   
3. **Mobile-specific tips**:
   - Hold your device in portait orientation for better visualization
   - Use small, deliberate pinch gestures for precise zooming
   - Tap the reset zoom button on the curve (↺) if you get lost

## Pitch Visualization Details

The pitch visualization shows the fundamental frequency (pitch) of the voice over time:

- **Blue line**: Your recorded voice
- **Green line**: Native speaker's voice

The y-axis shows frequency in Hertz (Hz), typically ranging from 50-500 Hz, with male voices generally lower (80-180 Hz) and female voices higher (160-300 Hz).
